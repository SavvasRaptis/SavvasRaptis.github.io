Abstract:
------

The magnetosheath (MSH) plasma turbulence depends on the structure and properties
of the bow shock (BS). Under quasi-parallel (Q||) and quasi-perpendicular (Q⊥) BS
configurations the electromagnetic field and plasma quantities possess quite distinct
behavior, e.g., being highly variable and structured in the Q|| case. Previous studies have
reported abundance of thin current sheets (with typical scales of the order of the plasma
kinetic scales) in the Q|| MSH, associated with magnetic reconnection, plasma heating,
and acceleration. Here we use multipoint observations from Magnetospheric MultiScale
(MMS) mission, where for the first time a comparative study of discontinuities and current
sheets in both MSH geometries at very small spacecraft separation (of the order of the ion
inertial length) is performed. In Q|| MSH the current density distribution is characterized
by a heavy tail, populated by strong currents. There is high correlation between these
currents and the discontinuities associated with large magnetic shears. Whilst, this
seems not to be the case in Q⊥ MSH, where current sheets are virtually absent.
We also investigate the effect of the discontinuities on the scaling of electromagnetic
fluctuations in the MHD range and in the beginning of the kinetic range. There are
two (one) orders of magnitude higher power in the magnetic (electric) field fluctuations
in the Q|| MSH, as well as different spectral scaling, in comparison to the Q⊥ MSH
configuration. This is an indication that the incoming solar wind turbulence is completely
locally reorganized behind Q⊥ BS while even though modified by Q|| BS geometry, the
downstream turbulence properties are still reminiscent to the ones upstream, the latter
confirming previous observations. We show also that the two geometries are associated
with different temperature anisotropies, plasma beta, and compressibility, where the Q⊥
MSH is unstable to mostly mirror mode plasma instability, while the Q|| MSH is unstable
also to oblique and parallel fire-hose, and ion-cyclotron instabilities.
