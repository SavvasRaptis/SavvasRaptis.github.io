Abstract:
------

Using Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) data, we find, classify, and analyze transient
dynamic pressure enhancements in the magnetosheath (jets) from May 2015 to May 2019. A classification
algorithm is presented, using in situ MMS data to classify jets (N = 8,499) into different categories
according to their associated angle between interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and the bow shock normal
vector (θBn). Jets appearing for θBn <45 are referred to as quasi-parallel, while jets appearing for θBn >45 as
quasi-perpendicular jets. Furthermore, we define those jets that occur at the boundaries between
quasi-parallel and quasi-perpendicular magnetosheath as boundary jets. Finally, encapsulated jets are
jet-like structures with similar characteristics to quasi-parallel jets while the surrounding plasma is of
quasi-perpendicular nature. We present the first statistical results of such a classification and provide
comparative statistics for each class. Furthermore, we investigate correlations between jet quantities.
Quasi-parallel jets have the highest dynamic pressure while occurring more often than quasi-perpendicular
jets. The infrequent quasi-perpendicular jets have a much smaller duration, velocity, and density and are
therefore relatively weaker. We conclude that quasi-parallel and boundary jets have similar properties and
are unlikely to originate from different generation mechanisms. Regarding the encapsulated jets, we
suggest that they are a special subset of quasi-parallel jets originating from the flanks of the bow shock, for large IMF cone angles although a relation to flux transfer events (FTEs) and magnetospheric plasma is also
possible. Our results support existing generation theories, such as the bow shock ripple and
SLAMS-associated mechanisms while indicating that other factors may contribute as well.
