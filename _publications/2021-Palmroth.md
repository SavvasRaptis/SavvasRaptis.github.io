Abstract:
------

Magnetosheath jets are regions of high dynamic
pressure, which can traverse from the bow shock towards the
magnetopause. Recent modelling efforts, limited to a single
jet and a single set of upstream conditions, have provided the
first estimations about how the jet parameters behave as a
function of position within the magnetosheath. Here we expand
the earlier results by doing the first statistical investigation
of the jet dimensions and parameters as a function of
their lifetime within the magnetosheath. To verify the simulation
behaviour, we first identify jets from Magnetosphere
Multiscale (MMS) spacecraft data (6142 in total) and confirm
the Vlasiator jet general behaviour using statistics of 924
simulated individual jets. We find that the jets in the simulation
are in quantitative agreement with the observations, confirming
earlier findings related to jets using Vlasiator. The jet
density, dynamic pressure, and magnetic field intensity show
a sharp jump at the bow shock, which decreases towards the
magnetopause. The jets appear compressive and cooler than
the magnetosheath at the bow shock, while during their propagation
towards the magnetopause they thermalise. Further,
the shape of the jets flatten as they progress through the magnetosheath.
They are able to maintain their flow velocity and
direction within the magnetosheath flow, and they end up
preferentially to the side of the magnetosheath behind the
quasi-parallel shock. Finally, we find that Vlasiator jets during
low solar wind Alfvén Mach number MA are shorter in
duration, smaller in their extent, and weaker in terms of dynamic
pressure and magnetic field intensity as compared to
the jets during high MA.
